* API server for storing forecast data
** Requirements
- Python 3.7.5 (might work with other versions too, this one is tested)
  
** Installation guide
This guide assumes that:
- you have opened a shell within this folder,
- your Python installation is called "python".

Disclaimer: this installation is tested with Linux, steps might be different for different distributions.

*** 1. Create a virtual environment (venv) named ".venv" with python
#+begin_src shell
python -m venv .venv
#+end_src

*** 2. Activate the virtual environment
#+begin_src shell
source .venv/bin/activate
#+end_src

*** 3. Install the dependencies with pip and requirements.txt
Now you can easily get all the needed libraries for your python virtual environment:
#+begin_src shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

Now you have succesfully installed the API!
